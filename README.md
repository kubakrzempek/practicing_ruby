##Practicing Ruby

In January 2014, [Practicing Ruby](https://practicingruby.com) has released majority of its articles into their [public archives](https://practicingruby.com/#public-archives).

###Why the repo?

While reading the first 4-5 articles and having much more ahead of me I though to myself - how am I suposed to remember all of this?

So I created the repo where I'm about to store my notes, key facts from articles, and code I will produce along the way. Just for reference to get back to it in the future, see difference of my problem solving, gain a base for _kata_ like sessions.
